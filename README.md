### **History**

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was founded on 22 December, 1911, after legislation was passed by Andrew Fisher's Labour government. The first branch commenced operations on 15 July 1912, at 317 Collins Street, Melbourne.

The bank was founded by King O'Malley and the 5th Prime Minister of Australia, Andrew Fisher. 

O'Malley was an American-born Australian and keen federalist, who originally campaigned as an independent    for the new House of Representatives. In 1901, he joined the Australian Labour Party and was a strong advocate for the creation of a national bank.  He served in the House of Representatives until 1917.

Andrew Fisher served three separate terms as Prime Minister of Australia, between 1908 and 1915, however it was his second term between 1910 and 1913 that saw wide-ranging reforms passed, including the establishment of old-age and disability pensions, enshrined new workersâ€™ rights in legislation, began construction of the Trans-Australian Railway, formed the Australian Capital Territory and was responsible for the establishment of the Commonwealth bank of Australia. 

The bank had the duel role of operating as a trading and savings bank, in addition to acting as Australia's central bank. However, the *Reserve Bank Act 1959* was established and on 14 January 1960, the Reserve Bank of Australia took control of the nation's central banking operations. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation was then able to focus on trading, savings and development banking.

Between 1991 and 1996, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation was privatised by the Australian government and became known as the Commonwealth bank. An initial public offering took place in 1991 to raise capital and the proceeds totalled approximately $1.3 billion. The second share offer was in 1993 for $1.7 billion and the third was in 1996 for $5 billion.

### **Business Activities**

The Commonwealth Bank recently announced that it would become Australia's first bank to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold crpyto assets, directly through the CommBank app.

The company's research showed that a large proportion of its customers want access to crypto assets for investment purposes, many of which are already buying, selling and holding crypto through a variety of other exchanges.

Matt Comyn, the CEO of CBA said: *"The emergence and growing demand for digital currencies from customers creates both challenges and opportunities for the financial services sector, which has seen a significant number of new players and business models innovating in this area. We believe we can play an important role in crypto to address what's clearly a growing customer need and provide capability, security and confidence in a crypto trading platform".*

CBA has formed an exclusive partnership in Australia with Gemini, which is one of the world's largest crypto exchange and custody service providers. This exclusive partnership will provide CBA a competitie advantage over its other banking competitors, such as NAB, Westpac and ANZ. CBA plans to integrate the Gemini platform into their existing CommBank app through APIs.

### **Landscape**
Commonwealth Bank has operated in the traditional banking and finance domain, which has seen some of the biggest advancements in technology to date. 

Banking has become increasingly more digital as customers become less loyal to their local branch. Banks have started using open banking, which used application programming interfaces (APIs) to make data available for accredited third parties, allowing consumers to gain greater access and control over their banking data. This makes it easier to switch products, such as savings accounts and home loans. 

Neobanks, commonly referred to as digital banks, operate without a physical branch. The barriers to entry for new banks were lowered after a legislative change in 2018, which has seen a significant rise of neobanks in Australia. They are generally more cost effective and more nimble than traditional banks.

The major competitors to Commonwealth Bank have traditionally been the National Australian Bank, ANZ and Westpac. However, with the rise of neobanks, the competitors have increased and digital banks such as UBank, ING, RaboDirect and ME Bank have taken significant market share.
